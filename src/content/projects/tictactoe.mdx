# Tic Tac Toe

This project started as a JavaScript exercise and a way to challenge myself to get better at coding / JS. But once I finished the base logic of Tic Tac Toe I had no one to play against so I decided to add a robot to play against.

Tic Tac Toe has 196839 (3^9) possible positions which might sound like a lot of ways to play the game. But for a computer, this number is quite low. It is quite easy to brute force your way through all the possible positions and calculate the best move from there.


import TicTacToe from '../../components/TicTacToe.svelte'

<TicTacToe client:load></TicTacToe>

## But how?

Using the Minimax algorithm you can search through the entire game tree to look for the best possible move given a certain board position.
Once a winning position is reached or all board squares are filled I evaluate the board and assign it a score. If the position is winning for the computer it gets a score of +1, if the position is winning for the human it gets a score of -1 and if the game is a draw it gets a score of 0. After having looked through all the possible positions it picks the move with the highest chance of winning.

Later I updated this project to include alpha-beta pruning. Once fully implemented this sped up the search for the best move by about 10 times, which is truly crazy. Alpha-beta pruning works by not having to examine game positions that are determined to be worse than a previously looked at move.
