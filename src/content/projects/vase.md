# Drop the vase

Drop the Vase is a project where I use Blender (the modeling software, not the kitchen appliance) where I try to generate vases as procedural as possible or with as little input as possible.

 <ul class="grid projects--grid">
    <li class="span-4">
        <img src="/img/vase/vase1.jpg" alt="Blender vase 1">
    </li>
    <li class="span-4">
        <img src="/img/vase/vase2.jpg" alt="Blender vase 2">
    </li>
    <li class="span-4">
        <img src="/img/vase/vase3.jpg" alt="Blender vase 3">
    </li>
</ul>
