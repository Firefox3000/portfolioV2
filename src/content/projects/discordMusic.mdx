# Discord Music

![Discord music, a discord bot that plays music](/img/discordMusic/discord-music-dark.png)
Discord music is a discord bot that plays youtube audio inside Discord voice channels.

{/* TODO origin story */}

## Usage

Using the bot is fairly easy. If you are inside a voice channel, the bot is in the Discord server and you type the text command `!play link/search term` inside chat. The bot will search for the corresponding video on Youtube, join the voice channel and play the audio of the video for you and your friends to enjoy.

## Tech stack

The bot is built using Node.js and Discord.js, a JavaScript library to simplify interaction with the Discord API.

## Hosting

Currently, I'm hosting the bot myself for a select few servers on a Raspberry Pi 4 with [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) to easily manage multiple Node.js processes like my [Stay Hydrated Twitch Bot](./stayhydratedbot).
