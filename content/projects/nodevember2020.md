# Node&shy;vember

Nodevember is all about procedural awesomeness and challenging yourself to improve your procedural skills. Every day of the month there is a new theme to make a render for. For all renders no external data/images were used, only nodes and math.
I chose to use blender 2.8x to make my renders since the node editor is very powerful and flexible.
