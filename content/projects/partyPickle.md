# Party pickle

Party Pickle is one of my first JavaScript projects. Created as the final assignment for my year one introduction to programming course, Party Pickle in its most basic form is a reskinned Tamagotchi.

You can feed your pickle, give him a drink or poke him so your pickle doesn't get mouldy. You can also bully your pickle by smashing the jar till it breaks.
