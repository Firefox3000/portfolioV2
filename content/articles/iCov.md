# iCov

iCov (infobox for Crimineel en Onverklaarbaar Vermogen) has a partnership with various government organizations to trace unlawful obtained assets so they can be confiscated and returned. However, with the tools they currently have, it can be quite hard to find suspicious relations.

So in commission for iCov we wanted to make sure that partners can analyze the relationship scan with as little time and effort as possible. This means we have to look at how to make the current solution better or think of something new. The new solution must be user-friendly and interactive.

My role in this project was the creation of the website and concepting part of the functionality inside of the app.
