# Stay hydrated bot

Stay Hydrated Fox is a Twitch Bot helping streamers maintain optimal hydration.
it does this by sending hourly hydration reminders with the amount of water the streamer should have consumed since they started streaming.

An average human should consume about 120mL an hour even though many do not.
Why 120 mL you may ask, well do I have an answer for you. Assuming the average human is awake for 16 hours a day and needs to consume approximately 2 Liters of that delicious hydrogen oxide. If you were to divide 2 liter by 16 hours you would get almost 120 mL of water an hour, the optimal hydration amount.

The chat bot is made using Node js and the Twitch api and can be easily hosted on a Raspberry Pi for example (which is what I did).
