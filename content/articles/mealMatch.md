# Meal Match

![Screenshot form the homepage of the Meal Match app](/img/mealMatch/mealMatchLogin.png)

Meal match is a dating app meant for people who are looking to get into some more serious dating focusing on dinner dates. It is just like first dates, with the only difference that you have to do the organizing yourself.

You can find people with the same interest and when you match you can start planning your first date while having a blast by sending funny gifs.

## My role

During this project, I was tasked to guide the team. Having a tiny bit more technical experience than the rest of the other team members. I set up the project on GitHub and helped the team with technical problems.
This was my first group project where I really to know the git workflow where you create issues, pull request, review and merge code.

## App features:

- Register / Login
- Liking / disliking other people
- Chatting with your matches (and sending gifs)
- A fill-in form for after the date

## Tech stack:

- Node.js
- Socket.io
- EJS
- MongoDB
- Heroku
